# DnD (Dungeons & Diagrams) Solver

This game is a constraint satisfaction problem, kind of like sudoku or a magic squares puzzle. Rather than explaining the rules myself, here are screenshots of the rules as presented in the game.

<img alt="Rules 6" src="../images/dnd/rules6.png" width="300px" />
<img alt="Rules 7" src="../images/dnd/rules7.png" width="300px" />
<img alt="Rules 8" src="../images/dnd/rules8.png" width="300px" />
</div>

One difference between the screenshots above and the actual game is that the real thing is played on an 8-by-8 board (rather than 6-by-6).
