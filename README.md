# Last Call BBS Solvers

[Last Call BBS](https://www.zachtronics.com/last-call-bbs/) is a great game -- I highly recommend it if quirky retro puzzling is your thing.

It's made of eight smaller games. Some of these are games of perfect information and therefore solvable. For the fun of it (not to cheat) I decided to implement solvers for some of these games. So far I have a solver for [Dungeons & Diagrams](./docs/dnd.md) and soon will write one for Kabufuda Solitaire.
