# DnD Solver

Over the weekend I downloaded a new game -- [Last Call BBS](https://www.zachtronics.com/last-call-bbs/). The game is a lot of fun -- I highly recommend it if quirky retro puzzling is your thing.

Last Call BBS is made of eight... games. The one of interest today is called _Dungeons & Diagrams_.

The game is a constraint satisfaction problem, kind of like sudoku or a magic squares puzzle. Rather than explaining the rules myself, here are screenshots of the tutorial.

<img alt="Tutorial 7" src="./images/tutorial7.png" width="300px" />
<img alt="Tutorial 8" src="./images/tutorial8.png" width="300px" />
</div>

One difference between the tutorial and the actual game is that the real thing is played on an 8-by-8 board (rather than 6-by-6).
